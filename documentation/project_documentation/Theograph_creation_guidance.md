# Theograph processing and dashboard creation

## Introduction

<br/>

## Packages
As the model is built and ran within the R programming language it will require dependent packages to be installed by the user. These packages will only require installing once. Please ensure that these packages are installed prior to running the model. This can be undertaken by using the `install.packages()` command within the console. For example `install.packages("here")` will install the `here` package. This can then be called with the `library(here)` command. 

For a full list of packages used in this model, please see the `packages.R` script found in the `config/r_scripts` folder. Users may need to manually install the `here` package as exampled above.
